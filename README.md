#TIC-TAC-TOE Game in React.

This is a game built to get started understanding basic react concepts like:

* **Function Components**
* **Props**
* **State**
* **Hooks**
* **JSX**
* **Breaking down views into smaller components**

AI is also integrated into the game using the [**min-max alogorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

[Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is also used in the styling of the UI.
